# loki-bulk-data-processor-examples

This is a sample Asp.Net Core Web API solution, demonstrating how to use Loki Bulk Data Processor.

In order to to run the API, the database needs to be created first using Entity Framework; to do this open up
the package manger console, and type the following command:

**Update-Database**

The easiest way to execute the Web API examples is to download Postman from https://www.postman.com/.

Then import the LokiTests.postman_collection.json file by clicking on file > import in postman.

This will import a collection of http requests that can be executed against this test Web API.
